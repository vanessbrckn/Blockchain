Blockchain.py is the file that handles the creation and parsing of the Blockchain.
unpackBlock() will convert a bunch of bytes into a block class and return it,
packBlock() will do the opposite. Once you have a block packed, it can be written 
to a file as bytes. Note that you will have to read and write the 'data' field
to/from the file separately, as the length of 'data' is variable. As of right now 
the functions don't bother with the data, but we can add that in later. It should 
work correctly, and is just about ready to be used by any and all other functions,
we just need to figure out what all we actually need from it.
